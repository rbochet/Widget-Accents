Accents Widget
==============

It's a small widget that aims to help people with a qwerty keyboard to type french accents on an Apple computer.

You can download this widget here : [http://lab.stackr.fr/widgets/](http://lab.stackr.fr/widgets/) 

French accents are mandatory, since they can differenciate two words.

* Biscuits sal_é_s: salted biscuits
* Biscuits sal_e_s: dirty biscuits

Rather useful things, isn't it?

Others things
-------------

I used Dashcode to make this widget. The icon has been made using the keyboard icon from [this](http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3ADarkGlass_Reworked) set. As it is licensed under the GPL, I assume that my icon has now the same license :)

Some of the strings are localized in English.

Please feel free to use / translate / adapt it as you want! It's a do-what-u-want license.
